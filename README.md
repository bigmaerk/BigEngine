# BigEngine
Big Engine is a lightweight, easy-to-learn, visual-coding 3D game engine targeted towards beginner game-devs. This game engine can be used to kickstart game devs into using more conventional engines, such as [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/). <br />
It is also powerful for more experienced developers, allowing for more advanced features.<br />

### NOTE:
<b>I will not be sharing the source code here, as Microsoft's Copilot on Github takes code from public repos for training (also I just dont want you seeing my embarrassingly bad code), Sorry for any inconvenience. <br />
However, I will share resources I used to make this, they're at the bottom.</b>
<br />
## Current features are: <br />

● Extensive customization features <br />
● Multiple Render Engines (such as Phong, Blinn-phong, Gouraud, Ray Tracing, etc.) <br />
● Ease of use to new and experienced game devs <br />
